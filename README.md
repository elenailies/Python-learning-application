 The application provides easy-to-understand lessons that provide the ability to run a code
relevant, and the user has the possibility to make changes to the code for experimental purposes.
To ensure the understanding of the knowledge, at the end of the lesson the user will complete a short
test, and if it is completed correctly, you will be able to move on to the next lesson. For
deepening the knowledge acquired during the lessons the user can complete tests
grille. To practice the technical terms present in the lessons, the user can complete a game
of words. A sense of community is created through a forum that encourages users to
share ideas, ask for help or start discussions of common interest.
To be easy to use by children, the application has an intuitive interface, design
minimalist and enjoyable ways to practice knowledge.

 There are four types of users in the application: unregistered user, user,
collaborator, admin, the admin being able to change the role of a user. After creating an account,
the registered user takes the role of a User, this role can only be changed by the Admin.
The unregistered user can view the posts in the forum but cannot post or
comment within the posts. It cannot access the tutorials, grid quizzes or the game
words.
User is the registered user for whom the application is intended. This has
limited rights. A User can view the lessons within the tutorials, and at the end he can
complete the assessment within them. To remember certain terms more easily it can
participate in a word game. To check the acquired knowledge in detail, the user
can complete Contributor-created grid tests and view their scores in
their framework. Within the forum he can add posts to be approved or
rejected by admin, can add comments to posts with the right to edit or delete
your own comments and posts.

 Collaborator is a registered user who has all the attributes of a User, and in addition he
can create grid tests with the right to edit and delete own tests, add categories for
posts with the right to edit and delete their own added categories. A user can become
Collaborator through an admin.
Admin is a registered user who has all the attributes of a Contributor, and in addition
it can change a user's role or delete the user, approve or reject posts
sent by the User or Collaborator. He can edit or delete post categories, posts,
comments, grid tests regardless of which user they belong to. An Admin can add posts without
for them to be sent for approval.
